gen_mtrand.py
- generate a multi-threaded test, running the test multiple times

cycle_checker.py
- creates a dependency graph based on static and dynamic information
- propagates dependencies assuming they are transitive
- checks for cyclic dependency

diff_hist.py
- computes the difference between a pair of executions in execution pool
- k-medoids clustering implemented... preliminary evaluation on how many medoids are required

instruction.py
- includes a class definition for instruction, and related functions that are used in conjunction with the class

parse_prog.py
- parses the generated program from intermediate form (see prog.txt)
- includes static information (program assembly code, address/consistency dependencies)

parse_hist.py
- parses the history of loaded values (see hist.txt)
- includes dynamic information for each of all executions

create_dot_graph.py
- creates dot graphs from static information (prog.txt) and dynamic information (hist.txt) from multiple executions

rand_stat.py
- runs md5 checksum for each of the specified files, generating the list of unique md5 checksums (after filtering out duplicated md5 checksums)
