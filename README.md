# MTraceCheck

This project provides a memory consistency validation framework, called MTraceCheck. Our ISCA (International Symposium of Computer Architecture) 2017 paper (http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3079856.3080235) describes technical details.

## Contents
1. Constrained-random test generator
2. Simple architectural simulator for multi-core memory subsystem
3. Code instrumentator for memory-access interleaving signature
4. Collective graph checker
